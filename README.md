# California Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression
This project implements Linear Regression using the California Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets. The goal is to predict house prices based on various features such as median income, number of rooms, house age, and more.

# Features & Functionality:
Dataset: Uses fetch_california_housing() from Scikit-Learn.

Preprocessing: Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Model: Implements Linear Regression using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.

Evaluation: Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure model performance.

Visualization: Plots Predicted vs Actual Prices using Matplotlib.
 
 
# How to Run the Code?
1. Install dependencies:
   
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

3. Run the script:
   
python california_housing.py



# Sample Output:
✅ Mean Squared Error: 0.5243

📉 Visualization: Scatter plot comparing predicted vs actual house prices.
